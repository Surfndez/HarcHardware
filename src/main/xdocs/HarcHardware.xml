<title>Introduction</title>
<p>
    This is a collection of classes for accessing hardware for home automation
and remote, in particular infrared, control. </p>

<p>It is intended as a support library for application programs, not as a
user friendly program aimed at end users. It is currently used by  programs like <a
href="IrScrutinizer.html">IrScrutinizer</a> and <a
href="IrMaster.html">IrMaster</a>.</p>

<p>There are classes for infrared sending and receiving by communicating with
IR sending/receiving hardware, for serial
communication as well as ethernet communication with sockets or HTTP, classes
for implementing LAN beacons and beacon listeners, among others. </p>

<p>It is largely designed upon interfaces, so that application programs can
access different hardware, e.g. for IR sending, in a uniform way. See the class
<code>Main</code> for an example.
